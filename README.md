# Machine Learning Course HW

hw assignments as part of the technion's electrical engineering faculty ML course (046195) 

## hw1:
In this assignment we will be looking at the data from an automatic bike rental service (similar to "תל-אופן") which operates in the city of Seoul. The dataset which we will be working with has been collected for every hour of the day over a period of one year. For each hour the dataset contains the number of bikes rented along with a few weather indicator such as the temperature, the wind speed and the amount of rain.

In this assignment we will try to predict the number of the bikes which are going to be rented based on the day of the week, the hour of the data and the weather. We shall use RMSE cost as our cost function.

This dataset has been made available by the UCI's (University of California, Irvine) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.

## hw2:
Implementation of a decision tree regressor for predicting the number of rented bikes according to different features

## hw3:
finding the distributions of data (the results of a marathon) using non parametric/parametric generative methods.
